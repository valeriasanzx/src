    Unit tests for validating the t3 agent's efficacy. Notes:
    - If this is the set of tests provided in the solution skeleton, it represents an
      incomplete set that you are expected to add to to adequately test your submission!
    - Your correctness score on the assignment will be assessed by a more complete,
      grading set of unit tests.
    - A portion of your style grade will also come from proper type hints; remember to
      validate your submission using `mypy .` and ensure that no issues are found.
