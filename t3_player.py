def choose(state: "T3State") -> Optional["T3Action"]:
    """
    Main workhorse of the T3Player that makes the optimal decision from the max node
    state given by the parameter to play the game of Tic-Tac-Total.
    
    [!] Remember the tie-breaking criteria! Moves should be selected in order of:
    1. Best utility
    2. Smallest depth of terminal
    3. Earliest move (i.e., lowest col, then row, then move number)
    
    You can view tiebreaking as something of an if-ladder: i.e., only continue to
    evaluate the depth if two candidates have the same utility, only continue to
    evaluate the earliest move if two candidates have the same utility and depth.
    
    Parameters:
        state (T3State):
            The board state from which the agent is making a choice. The board
            state will be either the odds or evens player's turn, and the agent
            should use the T3State methods to simplify its logic to work in
            either case.
    
    Returns:
        Optional[T3Action]:
            If the given state is a terminal (i.e., a win or tie), returns None.
            Otherwise, returns the best T3Action the current player could take
            from the given state by the criteria stated above.
